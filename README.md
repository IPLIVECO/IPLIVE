# IPLIVE
Entertainment the way it should be

I will hopefully be launching this project soon, check this README and my website www.iplive.co for updates

Let's get it going already... geez... well here's the start:

Project 1 - M3UMASTER:
Inside of the "m3u" folder you will find a php file. This file requires no 3rd party addons/plugin to run. Simply upload it to  a public web directory with the parameters as such: "www.iplive.co/m3umaster.php?title=the big bang theory s01e01". Spaces will work in broswer but in other applications it may need URL encoding ie. "www.iplive.co/m3umaster.php?title=the%20big%20bang%20theory%20s01e01". If the title exists anywhere in any of the M3U lists then it will display as a link in the webpage. Enjoy
